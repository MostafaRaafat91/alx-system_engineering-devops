Certainly! Let's design a three-server web infrastructure for hosting www.foobar.com with the specified requirements. I'll provide an ASCII art diagram and explain each component.

Explanation:
- The user types `www.foobar.com` in their browser.
- DNS resolves `www.foobar.com` to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
- Nginx (web server) handles HTTP requests and routes them to the Python application server.
- The application server processes requests, interacts with the MySQL database, and generates dynamic content.

### Additional Elements and Explanations:

1. **Firewalls:**
   - We add firewalls to protect the servers from unauthorized access.
   - Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.

2. **SSL Certificate (HTTPS):**
   - We use an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS (encrypted traffic).
   - HTTPS ensures secure communication between the user's browser and the web server.

3. **Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):**
   - Monitoring tools (e.g., Sumologic) collect data for analysis.
   - Data collectors monitor server performance, logs, and metrics.

### Monitoring and Data Collection:

- Monitoring helps track server health, resource usage, and potential issues.
- Data collectors collect logs, metrics, and events from servers and services.

### Monitoring Web Server QPS:

- To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second):
  - Set up monitoring tools to collect request counts.
  - Analyze the data to understand traffic patterns and identify bottlenecks.

### Issues with This Infrastructure:

1. **Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level:**
   - SSL termination at the load balancer exposes decrypted traffic internally.
   - Consider end-to-end encryption (terminate SSL at the application server).

2. **Single MySQL Server for Writes:**
   - Having only one MySQL server accepting writes is a single point of failure.
   - Consider replication (Master-Slave setup) for fault tolerance.

3. **Servers with Identical Components:**
   - Uniform servers may lead to resource contention (e.g., CPU, memory).
   - Optimize resource allocation based on workload.
