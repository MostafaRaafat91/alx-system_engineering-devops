Certainly! Let's design a three-server web infrastructure for hosting the website www.foobar.com. I'll explain each component and address the specified points.

### Infrastructure Design:

1. **Server 1 (Web Server):**
   - This server hosts the Nginx web server.
   - Nginx handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and acts as the entry point for incoming traffic.
   - Why? Nginx efficiently manages connections, load balancing, and SSL termination.

2. **Server 2 (Application Server):**
   - The application server executes server-side code (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java).
   - It generates dynamic content based on user requests.
   - Why? Separating application logic from the web server allows scalability and flexibility.

3. **Server 3 (Database Server - MySQL):**
   - MySQL stores data (user accounts, product info, etc.).
   - The application server communicates with the database to read/write data.
   - Why? Centralized data storage and efficient data retrieval.

4. **Load Balancer (HAProxy):**
   - HAProxy distributes incoming requests across multiple servers (web and app).
   - It uses a distribution algorithm (e.g., round-robin, least connections) to balance the load.
   - Why? Load balancing ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

5. **Application Files (Code Base):**
   - Your code (application logic, HTML templates, etc.) resides here.
   - The application server executes this code.
   - Why? Separating code from infrastructure simplifies maintenance and updates.

### Specifics Explained:

- **Load Balancer Algorithm:**
  - HAProxy can use various algorithms:
    - **Round-Robin:** Cycles through servers sequentially.
    - **Least Connections:** Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
    - **Source IP Hash:** Distributes based on the client's IP address.
  - The chosen algorithm depends on the use case and performance requirements.

- **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive:**
  - **Active-Active:** All servers handle traffic simultaneously. Scalable but complex.
  - **Active-Passive:** One server (active) handles traffic; others remain idle (passive). Failover occurs if the active server fails.
  - Choose based on workload and redundancy needs.

- **Database Primary-Replica Cluster:**
  - **Primary (Master):** Accepts write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
  - **Replica (Slave):** Replicates data from the primary. Read-only operations (SELECT) can be performed.
  - Replication ensures data consistency and fault tolerance.

- **Issues with This Infrastructure:**
  1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** Each server is still a potential SPOF. Consider redundancy (more servers) or cloud-based solutions.
  2. **Security Issues:**
     - No firewall: Implement a firewall to control incoming/outgoing traffic.
     - No HTTPS: Add SSL certificates to secure data in transit.
  3. **No Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track server health, performance, and resource usage.

Explanation:
- The user types `www.foobar.com` in their browser.
- DNS resolves `www.foobar.com` to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
- Nginx (web server) handles HTTP requests and routes them to the Python application server.
- The application server processes requests, interacts with the MySQL database, and generates dynamic content.

Issues with This Infrastructure:
1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** Each server is still a potential SPOF. Consider redundancy (more servers) or cloud-based solutions.
2. **Security Issues:**
   - Implement a firewall to control incoming/outgoing traffic.
   - Add SSL certificates (HTTPS) for secure data transmission.
3. **No Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track server health and performance.
