Certainly! Let's create an ASCII art diagram for the web infrastructure that distinguishes between the application server and the web server. I'll explain each component as well.

Explanation:
- The user types `www.foobar.com` in their browser.
- DNS resolves `www.foobar.com` to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
- Nginx (web server) handles HTTP requests and serves static content.
- The application server executes server-side code (Python, Node.js, etc.).
- The MySQL database stores data (user accounts, product info).

### Additional Elements and Explanations:

1. **Load-Balancer (HAProxy):**
   - We add a load balancer (HAProxy) to distribute traffic between the web server and the application server.
   - Load balancing ensures high availability and efficient resource utilization.

2. **Split Components:**
   - Separating components (web server, app server, database) onto their own servers allows scalability and isolation.
   - Each component can be optimized independently.

Remember that this design can be customized further based on specific project needs! ðŸ˜Š
